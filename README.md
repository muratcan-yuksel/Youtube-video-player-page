<h1> Youtube Video Player Page </h1>  
The goal of this project was to understand how to embed videos into a web page <br> 
I focused on using Flexbox, for I believe that if I can learn it better, <br>it would be a great and easy way to style web pages  <br>
I had great troubles trying to stack the video images with captions next to them on the side  <br>
It's not responsive, so whenever the viewport gets smaller, the sidebar collapses on the comments  <br>
I don't know how to fix it yet<br>
The page can be vieweb from here : https://muratcan-yuksel.github.io/Youtube-video-player-page/  <br>
I hope it works on other devices also
