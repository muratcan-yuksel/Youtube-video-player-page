<h1> Youtube Video Player Page </h1>  
The goal of this project was to understand how to embed videos into a web page  
I focused on using Flexbox, for I believe that if I can learn it better, <br>it would be a great and easy way to style web pages  
I had great troubles trying to stack the video images with captions next to them on the side  
It's not responsive, so whenever the viewport gets smaller, the sidebar collapses on the comments  
I don't know how to fix it yet
The page can be vieweb from here : https://muratcan-yuksel.github.io/Youtube-video-player-page/  
I hope it works on other devices also
